# Microservices Architecture

## Overview
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## Key Characteristics
- Independent deployment
- Service autonomy
- Decentralized data management
- Technology diversity

## Benefits
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Resilience
- Easy maintenance

## Challenges
- Distributed system complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency
- Testing complexity

## Best Practices
1. Design services around business capabilities
2. Implement API gateway
3. Use service mesh for communication
4. Implement circuit breakers
5. Centralized logging and monitoring

## Communication Patterns
- Synchronous: REST, gRPC
- Asynchronous: Message queues, Event streaming
