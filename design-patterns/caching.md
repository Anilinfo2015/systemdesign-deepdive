# Caching Design Pattern

## Overview
Caching is a design pattern that stores frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer to improve performance and reduce latency.

## Key Concepts
- Cache Hit: Data found in cache
- Cache Miss: Data not found in cache
- Cache Invalidation: Removing or updating stale data

## Common Cache Strategies
1. **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache explicitly
2. **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
3. **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, database later
4. **Read-Through**: Cache loads data on miss

## Benefits
- Reduced latency
- Lower database load
- Better scalability

## Challenges
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Memory constraints
- Consistency issues
