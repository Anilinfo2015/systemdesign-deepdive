- Event-driven architecture patterns and when to use them
- Trade-offs between different architectural approaches

### Scalability Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to handle load
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading individual machine resources
- When to choose each approach and hybrid strategies

### Design Patterns for Distributed Systems
- **Caching Patterns**: Cache-aside, write-through, write-behind strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin, weighted, least-connections algorithms
- **Circuit Breakers**: Preventing cascade failures in distributed systems

### Production-Ready Systems
- Monitoring, observability, and SLO/SLI/SLA definitions
- Security considerations: authentication, authorization, rate limiting
